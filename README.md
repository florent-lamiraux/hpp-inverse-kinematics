# Exact inverse kinematics for some industrial robots

This package implements exact inverse kinematics for some industrial robots as an explicit
constraint as defined in `hpp-constraints`. The constraint is a grasp constraint as defined in
`hpp-manipulation`. It takes an additional variable since exact inverse kinematics might have
several solutions. The additional  variable may be an extra-configuration space variable and is
assumed to be integer valued.

Right now, only robots of the serie St√§ubli TX2 are supported, but extension to other robots
should not be difficult.
